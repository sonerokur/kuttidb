# Release process

How official KuttiDB binaries are built, tested, and published. The pipeline
lives in [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml)
and is fully tag-driven: a tag is the release. The container image is
published by
[`.github/workflows/release-docker.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-docker.yml)
on the same `v*` tags.

Client SDK packages (PyPI, npm, crates.io, the Go module) are released
separately with their own language-prefixed tag scheme — see
[CLIENT_PUBLISHING.md](CLIENT_PUBLISHING.md).

## Release gates (atomic job completion)

A release that ships atomic job completion must record, per target platform
(Linux glibc x86_64/arm64, macOS x86_64/arm64, Alpine/musl container):

- `make test` (core + `job_state_test` + `job_completion_test` +
  `job_crash_test_jobfailpoints` + protocol/SDK suites) and
  `ctest` in a Release CMake build (`-UNDEBUG` protection is wired for the
  job tests).
- The crash/recovery matrix runs natively per architecture; cross compilation
  is build evidence only, not crash/recovery evidence. If a runner is
  missing, leave that matrix cell explicitly unverified in the release notes.
- TLS ON and TLS OFF builds both execute the job suites (failpoints are
  test-only and never compiled into production binaries).
- Client suites: Python (`test_job_client.py`), C/C++ (`job_client_test`,
  `job_client_cpp_test`), Go (`go test -run TestJobCompletion`), Java
  (`JobSmoke`), Rust (`cargo test --test job_completion`), Node
  (`job_smoke.js`). Packaged-distribution checks import the installed
  packages, not repository-relative sources.
- Minimum compatible versions: the feature requires server protocol ≥ 1.8
  (capability bit 16) and the matching first SDK release that ships the job
  surface; older released packages do not contain it — state this in the
  notes rather than implying otherwise.

## Release cycle

KuttiDB is pre-1.0 and uses `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with optional pre-release
suffixes:

| Tag | Result |
|---|---|
| `v0.1.0` | Stable release of the 0.1 line |
| `v0.1.0-beta.1` | Pre-release — the hyphen makes the GitHub Release a *prerelease* |
| `v0.0.2` | Patch release |

Conventions while pre-1.0:

- **MINOR** bumps for milestone features (new messaging semantics, new
  platform support). These may include protocol-visible additions; the wire
  protocol negotiates capabilities, so clients keep working.
- **PATCH** bumps for fixes only — no new protocol capabilities.
- **Pre-releases** (`-beta.N`, `-rc.N`) for wider testing before a stable
  cut. Breaking durability or acknowledgement changes must land behind a
  pre-release first and be called out in the release notes.

There is no time-based cadence yet; releases follow project milestones.

## Cutting a release

1. **Gate locally.** The CI gate is the same suite, but run it first:
   ```sh
   make test
   ```
   A change to acknowledgement or recovery behavior must ship with its
   crash-test (see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)).

2. **Tag and push.** Annotated tags, `v` prefix:
   ```sh
   git tag -a v0.0.2 -m "KuttiDB 0.0.2"
   git push origin v0.0.2
   ```

3. **The pipeline takes over.** On the tag push, the `Release official
   binaries` workflow runs four build jobs in parallel:

   | Build | Runner | Runtime floor |
   |---|---|---|
   | `linux-x86_64` | `ubuntu-22.04` | glibc 2.35, OpenSSL 3 (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, RHEL 9+) |
   | `linux-arm64` | `ubuntu-22.04-arm` | same |
   | `macos-x86_64` | `macos-15-intel` | macOS 12+ (`CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=12.0`) |
   | `macos-arm64` | `macos-15` | macOS 12+ |

   Each job builds **both variants** from the same source (needs
   `libssl-dev` + `libcurl4-openssl-dev` on Linux): a CMake `Release` build
   with TLS → **full `ctest` suite as a release gate** (all 14 tests,
   including crash-recovery) on the telemetry-free build, the telemetry
   configuration test on the telemetry build → verification that OpenSSL is
   really linked → `--features` gate (`telemetry=off` / `telemetry=v1` +
   `telemetry-default=on`) → two tarballs + SHA-256 each.

4. **Release job publishes.** When all builds pass, it aggregates
   `SHASUMS256.txt` (eight tarballs) and creates the GitHub Release with the
   tarballs. A failed gate anywhere means **no release is published** — a
   partial release is not possible.

### Dry runs

Run the identical pipeline without publishing from the Actions tab
(*Release official binaries → Run workflow*) or:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml
```

Artifacts appear on the workflow run; no GitHub Release is created. Use this
when touching the build, packaging, or the workflow itself. For the container
image dry-run, see [Container image (GHCR)](#container-image-ghcr) below.

## Release artifacts

Every release ships two tarball variants per platform, built from the same
source:

- `kuttidb-<version>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` — **telemetry-free** (default). The
  reporter is not compiled in; `kuttidb --features` reports `telemetry=off`
  and reporting is impossible even with `--telemetry on`. The plain name is
  kept so existing scripts and mirrors keep receiving
  telemetry-not-included binaries.
- `kuttidb-<version>-telemetry-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` — **telemetry-capable,
  reporting on by default** (`-DKUTTIDB_TELEMETRY=ON
  -DKUTTIDB_TELEMETRY_DEFAULT_ON=ON`, curl + OpenSSL reporter).
  `kuttidb --features` reports `telemetry=v1` and `telemetry-default=on`; a
  server started without flags reports by default (state dir auto-resolved
  under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}`), and `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` or
  `--telemetry off` always disable it. This is the variant the installer
  ships when a user accepts the community-telemetry opt-in question
  (see [TELEMETRY.md](../guides/TELEMETRY.md)).

### Container image (GHCR)

The same `v*` tag also triggers
[`.github/workflows/release-docker.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-docker.yml),
which publishes:

- `ghcr.io/kuttidb/kuttidb:<version>` — multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`), Alpine `TLS=0` image from the repo `Dockerfile`
- `ghcr.io/kuttidb/kuttidb:latest` — only for stable tags (no hyphen in the tag name)

Dry run: Actions tab → *Release Docker image (GHCR)* → *Run workflow*, or
`gh workflow run release-docker.yml`. The pipeline builds multi-arch but does
**not** push version or `latest` tags to GHCR.

After first publish, make the GHCR package public if anonymous pulls are
desired. Do not re-publish an existing version; bump and cut a new tag.

Both variants contain:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kuttidb` | Server binary (TLS via OpenSSL linked in) |
| `kuttidb-bench` | Benchmark client |
| `libkuttidb_embed.so` / `.dylib` | Embedded library for SDK managed mode |
| `kuttidb-cli` | Python CLI client (needs `python3` at runtime) |
| `libkuttidb_client.so` / `.dylib` | Public C companion client for atomic job completion |
| `kuttidb_client.h` | Public C header for the companion (ownership, timeouts, typed errors) |
| `README.md`, `LICENSE` | Pointers and license terms |

Install: extract and copy `kuttidb` (and optionally `kuttidb-cli`) somewhere
on `PATH`; the C companion installs as
`libkuttidb_client.so`/`.dylib` + `kuttidb_client.h` (see
[CLIENT_PUBLISHING.md](CLIENT_PUBLISHING.md)). See
[GETTING_STARTED.md](../guides/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Hotfixes

For a regression on a released line, branch from the release tag:

```sh
git checkout -b hotfix-0.0.2 v0.0.2
# ... fix, test ...
git tag -a v0.0.3 -m "KuttiDB 0.0.3" && git push origin v0.0.3 hotfix-0.0.2
```

Then merge the fix back into `main`. Re-publishing an existing tag is not
supported: delete the release and tag only if the release is broken beyond
repair, and prefer a new patch version.

## Operational notes

- **Do not re-push a tag.** Releases are immutable; move forward with a new
  version instead.
- **Linux floor is set by the oldest runner.** The workflow pins
  `ubuntu-22.04` deliberately; moving to a newer image raises the glibc floor
  for every user — treat that as a compatibility decision, not a chore.
- **Windows is not built.** The platform layer still needs the IOCP /
  named-pipe / file-locking backend; that port is planned but not started.
- **macOS signing/notarization is not done yet.** Binaries are unsigned; the
  first run may need a right-click → Open or
  `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`. Gatekeeper policy is tracked in the
  roadmap.
- Workflow file changes only take effect once merged to the default branch —
  tag runs use the workflow definition *on the tag*, so a pipeline fix must be
  tagged too.
